    <p> Hi! My name is Sarah, and I live in Oahu, Hawaii.  </p>
    </br>
    <p> I have always loved books growing up, and I know that who I am today has been deeply impacted by the books I have read
        and encountered. There is always something to learn from books, whether it be stories, educational, or experiences. I feel like I can travel 
        anywhere and experience anything through books. That is why I built this website: to get your reviews and feedback from the books you've read! </p>
    </br>
       
    <p>I love this quote from Garrison Keillor," A book is a gift you can open again and again. " Happy reading!
